# Pocket Reform Backplate

Replacement aluminum CNC backplate for the [MNT Pocket Reform](https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-pocket-reform)

This is my own part based heavily on [pandora's](https://community.mnt.re/t/solving-heat-related-issues-with-custom-lid/2809/8) beautiful [replacement backplate](https://github.com/FesixGermany/mnt_pocket_reform_backplate) that seems to significantly improve the Pocket Reform's thermals.

**WARNING:** These designs have not yet been proven in manufacture. I have an order inbound from PCBWay and suggest that, unless you're _really really_ excited, you hold off ordering your own until I can confirm everything's good, or use pandora's designs which have been tested in the real world.
