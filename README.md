# Pocket Reform Backplate

Replacement aluminum CNC backplate for the [MNT Pocket Reform](https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-pocket-reform)

This is my own part based heavily on [pandora's](https://community.mnt.re/t/solving-heat-related-issues-with-custom-lid/2809/8) beautiful [replacement backplate](https://github.com/FesixGermany/mnt_pocket_reform_backplate) that seems to significantly improve the Pocket Reform's thermals.

## Manufacture

I ordered my version from [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com) using their [CNC Machining](https://www.pcbway.com/rapid-prototyping/manufacture/?type=1) service.

To order using this service you'll need to provide them with the following files:

- Model—[backplate.step](backplate.step)
- Technical Drawing—[backplate.pdf](backplate.pdf)

There are also a collection of detailed questions you'll need to provide answers to. The defaults are fine for most of them. The following seems to work well:
